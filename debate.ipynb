      "Argument: My opponent's argument overlooks a critical qualifier for strict liability regarding structures. While strict liability applies to the removal of lateral support for land in its natural state, it extends to damage to *buildings only if* the landowner can prove that the weight of the building itself did not contribute to the collapse. The problem states \"excessive excavating... causes the collapse of a large storage building,\" but it provides no information establishing that the land would have collapsed independently of the building's weight. Without such proof, the musician cannot automatically invoke strict liability for the building's damage and will instead need to prove the neighbor's excavations were negligent.\n",

      "Argument: My opponent's argument that the musician must prove the building's weight did not contribute to the collapse misconstrues the problem's explicit statement. The question asserts, \"The neighbor's excessive excavating... causes the collapse of a large storage building.\" This direct causal language means the excavation itself was the sufficient cause of the building's collapse, not that the building's weight was a contributing factor to the *land's* collapse. If the land would have remained stable but for the building's weight, the excavation would not be the sole cause of the building's collapse. Therefore, the problem's phrasing implicitly confirms that the condition for strict liability for buildings, which requires the building's weight not to have contributed to the collapse of the land, is met by the facts as presented.\n",

      "Argument: My opponent's interpretation of the problem's phrasing is a critical misdirection. The statement that \"excessive excavating... causes the collapse of a large storage building\" describes the ultimate outcome, but it does *not* inherently confirm that the land would have collapsed without the building's weight. It is entirely plausible that the excavation weakened the soil, and the building's weight then became the *final trigger* for the land's subsidence and subsequent collapse. The legal standard for strict liability for building damage explicitly requires proving the building's weight *did not contribute to the collapse of the land*. Since the problem provides no information to satisfy this specific condition, the musician cannot automatically invoke strict liability for the building's damage and must instead prove negligence.\n",

      "Argument: My opponent attempts to introduce ambiguity where the problem statement provides certainty. The phrase \"excessive excavating... causes the collapse of a large storage building\" is a definitive statement of direct causation. It means the excavation was the sufficient and proximate cause of the building's collapse. If, as my opponent suggests, the building's weight was a necessary *final trigger* for the *land's* subsidence, it would imply the land would not have collapsed solely from the excavation, thus making the excavation *not* the direct cause of the building's collapse. The problem's phrasing, therefore, implicitly confirms that the condition for strict liability for buildings, requiring the building's weight not to have contributed to the collapse of the land, is met by the given facts. To assume otherwise is to rewrite the problem's explicit causal link.\n",

      "Evidence: \"On other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of product liability, the courts have come to apply to principle of strict liability: the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.\" [Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causation_(law)]\n",

      "Argument: My opponent's argument still misapplies a general concept of 'direct causation' to a highly specific legal nuance. While the excavation certainly 'caused' the building's collapse in a general sense, the law of lateral support imposes strict liability for buildings *only if* the landowner proves the building's weight did not contribute to the *land's* collapse. The problem stating the excavation 'causes the collapse of a large storage building' describes the ultimate harm, but it *does not* provide the specific factual detail that the land itself would have collapsed independently of the building's weight. It's entirely plausible the excavation merely weakened the land, and the building's weight then became the critical factor in the land's subsidence. Without explicit information ruling out the building's weight as a contributor to the *land's* collapse, strict liability for the building cannot be assumed, and the musician must prove negligence.\n",
