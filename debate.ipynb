However, the problem explicitly states the neighbor was conducting a “sand removal business” that required “heavy hauling” and involved “excessive excavating.” This description points to an extreme degree of earth removal, which is fundamentally different from a minor excavation where a building's weight might tip the balance. Such extensive commercial excavation is a direct, substantial deprivation of lateral support, strongly implying that the land itself would have destabilized and collapsed due to the massive removal of material, making the storage building's collapse a direct consequence of this underlying land failure. Therefore, the musician is highly likely to meet the condition of showing that the land's collapse was due to the excavation, not primarily the building's weight, thus triggering strict liability for all resulting damages.\n",

While the neighbor's excavation was described as 'excessive,' this adjective alone does not satisfy the strict legal requirement for applying strict liability to the storage building.

The problem provides no evidence to establish this critical element; it simply states the excavation 'causes the collapse of a large storage building.'

The problem describes a commercial 'sand removal business' requiring 'heavy hauling' and 'excessive excavating.' This isn't a minor homeowner project; it's an industrial operation designed to remove vast quantities of earth. Such a systematic and extensive deprivation of lateral support, by its very nature, so fundamentally destabilizes the underlying land that it is highly improbable that the land's collapse was primarily due to the building's weight rather than the massive material removal itself.
